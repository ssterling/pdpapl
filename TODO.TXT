pdpapl To-Do List

=== Optimisation ===

NOTE: terminal input/output at 9600 baud is, in fact, not a bottleneck

- Fix the weird spaghetti mess in PDRW
- Keep CURCR in a register, not memory
	This could go one of two ways: either speed will *increase*
	because the amount of times core must be accessed to read
	CURCR is decreased, or speed will *decrease* because a new
	register must be pushed/popped whenever used outside the
	video processing subroutine.
	Needs testing once enough frames of the final product are done
	to be able to notice a difference.
- Implement CLRSCR and HOMPOS as macros
	May or may not actually increase speed; needs testing.
- Generally optimise branching
- Devise a more efficient UITOAB

=== Compatibility ===

- Possibly implement a substitute for ASH on systems lacking it

=== Considered Harmful ===

- Rid of local variables (if they're even a problem)
